# Citibike Ridesharing Analysis

## Overview 

For this analysis, Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 
After that the following analyses were computed using Tableau:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Create a story for all of these visualizations.


## Results

You can find the Tableau story analysis [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/domenick.avanzi/viz/RIDESHARING/RideSharingStory_1).
The results show that most users, both subscribers and single customer riders are male. Most subscriber men tend to travel on Thursdays more than any other days.


## Summary
Additional visualtizations to further investigate the subscriber male population. Seeing where the bulk of the bikes are picked up and dropped off may help citibike understand where to send repair trucks for bikes.
